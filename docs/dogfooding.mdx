We have [a DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/aracredmvp/home/)!

If you [contribute to conversations](https://discord.gg/nG4Ew2Y) and/or [help us lay down code](https://github.com/aracred) you'll earn [AraCred](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/aracredmvp/0x9da64e7b01a748eda68dc921739b27053669eb83/)!

## AraCred on AraCred

This part will talk about how we have AraCred setup to track contributions on Discord and GitHub, then mint tokens for contributors. 

> Note: at this time tokens have no governance or economic value - they're just tokens.
